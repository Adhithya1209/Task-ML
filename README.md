# Task-ML
Neural network with tunable hyperparameters (using Keras tuner)
The pkl file (dataset) is generated in a separate dataprep.py program and its values are generated randomly. That is, the values of the features and targets are random. 
Hence the results may not be consistent. To get a better and consistent result, a different pkl file with the features and targets having actual dependencies should be used
